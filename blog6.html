      <h2>Blog #6: Drowning Rats (Good Name for a Band)</h2>
      <h3>17 December 2025</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
         A <a href="https://www.aipro.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phenomena_sudden_death.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research article</a> from 1957 is often cited in 
         popular science and self-help materials as evidence of learned helplessness.
         <strong>Warning</strong>: it quotes a paper with crude descriptions of pre-industrial cultures that would <em>not</em> fit in today's research culture.
      </p>
      <p>
         My purpose is to dispell some of the myths surrounding the study by analyzing and clarifying the actual findings. I originally planned to use the paper as an intro for a blog post titled 
         "Microdosing Adversity", but the more I dove into the paper, the more I felt it deserved its own post. So look forward to Blog #??: Microdosing Adversity, coming to a modem near you!

      <h4>Hopeless rats drown in minutes, rescued rats swim for days?</h4>
      <p>
         Somewhere in your readings or conversations, you may have heard of a research study that tested the endurance of rats by putting them in inescapable water.
         In these stories, it is often said that naive rats placed in water that they cannot get out of will drown within a minute or two, while rats that are placed in
         the water, removed before drowning for a short respite, then returned to the water will swim for hours, sometimes days, before ultimately drowning.
      </p>
      <p>
         It turns out: no such study was performed! At least, not in the rigor or method that we would require today. This finding is inferred from anecdotes in the 1957 paper 
         "On the Phenomenon of Sudden Death in Animals and Man", written by psychobiologist Curt Richter (link above). Richter is best known for his work on circadian rhythms, and this is not a
         critique of his work but of the common misuse of this particular article.
      </p>
      <h4>The real findings of the paper</h4>
      <p>
         As the title suggests, this paper reports findings while designing a rat model for "sudden death", where people and animals die from extreme distress, rather than a
         specific, anatomical cause. It opens with references to a 1942 paper by Walter Cannon describing sudden death in pre-industrial societies induced by the belief in 
         harmful magic (so-called "voodoo death"). 
      </p>
      <p>
         As an example, Cannon uses an excerpt from the 1925 book <em>The Australian Aboriginal</em> by R. Herbert Basedow:
         <blockquote>
            The man who discovers that he is being boned [hexed] by an enemy is, indeed, a pitiable sight. He stands aghast with his eyes staring at the treacherous pointer, and with his hands lifted to ward off 
            the lethal medium, which he imagines is pouring into his body. His cheeks blanch, and his eyes become glassy, and the expression of his face becomes horribly distorted. He attempts to shriek but 
            usually the sound chokes in his throat, and all that one might see is froth at his mouth. His body begins to tremble and his mus- cles twitch involuntarily. He sways backward and falls to the ground, 
            and after a short time appears to be in a swoon. He finally composes himself, goes to his hut and there frets to death.
         </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
         Assuming these deaths are not caused by magic, Cannon hypothesized death is caused by an over-reaction of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words,
         a particularly shocking situation can cause an adrenaline rush so intense, it stops the heart. To model this in rats, Richter used jars filled with water of varying temperature (Figure 1).
         The rats are unable to escape the chamber, so the study effectively tests how long the rats swim before drowning with the added variable of water temperature.

      <p>
         Richter describes massive variation in swim endurance: "At all temperatures, a small number of rats died within 5-10 minutes after immersion, while in some instances 
         others apparently no more healthy, swam as long as 81 hours." However, rats swam much longer on average in warm water compared to cold or hot (Figure 2).

      <p>
         Recalling an earlier study where trimming whiskers led to the sudden death of a rat, Richter tried trimming whiskers prior to swim tests. He found some clipped rats drowned within minutes,
         even at the ideal water temperature of 95° F. This finding was more pronounced in crosses between wild and domesticated rats, and even more so in wild rats, where all 34 tested
         drowned in 1-15 minutes.
