      <h2>Project #1: Bare-Metal Self-Hosting with CI/CD</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/jlelia/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Repo</a></h3>
      
      <div class="tech-stack">
        <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Raspberry Pi 5 • Nginx • Bash • GitHub Actions (CI/CD) • HTML5/CSS3</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Objective</strong>: Architect a full-stack web presence from first principles, bypassing managed hosting services 
        to maintain complete control over the infrastructure and deployment pipeline.
      </p>

      <h3>Infrastructure & Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than relying on abstracted cloud hosting, I serve this site from a <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong> running in 
        my home network. This "bare-metal" approach requires managing the OS layer directly. I interact with the server exclusively 
        via SSH (headless), enforcing a command-line-first workflow that mirrors the environment of high-performance computing clusters used in my research.
      </p> 
      
      <h3>Automated Deployment (CI/CD)</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure code reproducibility and streamline updates, I engineered a <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> pipeline. I configured a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner directly on the Pi. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when I push changes to the repository, the runner automatically:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Pulls the latest commit</li>
          <li>Builds the static assets</li>
          <li>Deploys them to the Nginx serving directory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This eliminates manual file transfers (SCP) and ensures the live site always reflects the `main` branch state. This was also good practice for Python packaging workflows (<a href="/project2">Project 2</a>).
      </p>

      <h3>Security & Networking</h3>
      <p>
        Exposing a local machine to the open web requires security hardening. I utilize <strong>Nginx</strong> as a high-performance reverse proxy and secure the network using <strong>UFW</strong> (Uncomplicated Firewall) 
        and <strong>Fail2Ban</strong> to automatically mitigate intrusion attempts. I also ban IPs with suspicious behavior, which is easy to audit with <strong>GoAccess</strong>, a real-time log analysis tool.
