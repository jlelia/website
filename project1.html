      <h2>Project #1: Web Development</h2>
      <p>This website is one of my first programming projects. I am hosting the site on a Raspberry Pi 5, a computer smaller
	 than a cellphone that runs 24/7 in my home and receives web traffic (like you, dear visitor) through my router. The
	 entire setup cost about $100, and it already paid for itself considering the subscription fee I'd pay a company to host
	 my website.</p> 
      <p>My two major goals in this project are to become "fluent" in the Unix command line and to gain experience with every step 
         of web development. To facilitate this, I do everything through the command line, despite the Pi 5 having plenty of power
         for a smooth GUI. I use uncomplicated firewall (UFW) and fail2ban to help protect my home network, along with some other
	 nifty security tricks I won't disclose to keep visitors safe.</p>
      <p>On the software side, I am using Nginx, a popular, lightweight web server that's perfect for serving
	 static content, like text and images. I wrote the pages myself in HTML and CSS. Although I have a decent amount of experience
         with HTML via a newsletter I'd write for Nucleate, I often use GPT-4 for boilerplate styling and SEO.</p>
      <p>While calling this full-stack web development is technically true, it is also tongue-in-cheek. I know hosting and coding a
	 static website is a far cry from being a web developer. I've yet to seriously work with JavaScript, React, SQL, et cetera,
	 but I've loved the experience and accomplished my two goals: I am much more comfortable with the Unix-based command line
	 and the core concepts of hosting a website. It's an added bonus that when I finally looked up from the terminal, I had a
	 decent website looking back at me.</p>
