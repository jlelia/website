      <h2>Blog #1: Hello, Computer Science!</h2>
      <h3>16 May 2025</h3>
      <p>As a young boy, I loved mathematics. I remember taking pride in completing my multiplication tables before my classmates or being the first to grasp a new
	 concept in class. As I grew older, I faced personal challenges that made my home life miserable. I stopped doing my homework, stopped asking questions,
	 and stopped being viewed as "gifted" in math. It wasn't long before I found myself on the lower track, and I started believing I belonged there.</p> 
      <p>I nearly entered UMass Amherst as a political science major because of the calculus requirement in the natural sciences. But I decided college would
	 be my opportunity to turn things around, and I switched to biology during orientation weekend, no doubt causing headaches for my advisors. I figured
	 I could survive one class of calculus if it meant pursuing a degree I truly cared about.</p> 
      <p>Only problem: I never took trigonometry or pre-calc. In fact, I never even encountered logarithims or negative exponents, frequent operations in any 
	 calculus class. It felt like I had to work twice as hard to get half the grade, but I somehow scraped by with a B+. Statistics, chemistry, physics, and 
	 population genetics all went smoothly with my newfound confidence, and I achieved a 4.0 every semester after my first. I figured math was happily in my rearview mirror.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to the third summer of my PhD at Yale in the Pathology and Molecular Medicine program. Sick of a repetitive and unwieldy analysis, I started learning 
	 Python so I could write a simple automation script. Since then, I've become unable to picture my future career without at least some elements of computer
	 science. The power that just a little bit of programming competency brings to biology is awe-inspiring. Combine that feeling with the artificial intelligence
	 boom, and the realization comes naturally: "Oh no, I need math again".</p>
      <p>Between that fateful moment in July 2024 and now (May 2025), I've tried to read my way to a decent understanding of math, complexity, and AI. Here's a rough list:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><i>The Primacy of Doubt</i> by Tim Palmer</li>
	<li><i>Fooled by Randomness</i> by Nassim Taleb</li>
	<li><i>Hackers</i> by Steven Levy</li>
	<li><i>Nexus</i> by Yuval Harari</li>
	<li><i>Humble Pi</i> by Matt Parker</li>
	<li><i>Antifragile</i> by Nassim Taleb</li>
	<li><i>The Joy of X</i> by Steven Strogatz</li>
	<li><i>Source Code</i> by Bill Gates</li>
	<li><i>Rationality</i> by Steven Pinker</li>
	<li><i>Infinite Powers</i> by Steven Strogatz</li>
	<li><i>Artificial Intelligence</i> by Melanie Mitchell</li>
	<li><i>Genius</i> by James Gleick</li>
	<li><i>Chaos</i> by James Gleick</li>
	<li><i>The Alignment Problem</i> by Christian Brian</li>
	<li><i>Why Machines Learn</i> by Anil Ananthaswamy</li>	
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, reading is necessary but not sufficient to build the skills I desire. In between experiments, I'm usually working on a programming
	 project. Some are more fun, like <a href="/project1" target=_blank>building this website</a>, while others are directly related to my work in drug discovery,
	 like <a href="/project2" target=_blank>CellPyAbility</a>. I also dabble with practice problems, like those in <i>Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained</i>
	 by Al Sweigert or on <a href="projecteuler.net" target=_blank>Project Euler</a>.</p>
      <p>As a final piece of practice, I teach the very math I used to struggle with. I tutor for free through the non-profit I founded, <a href="e2mentors.org"
	 target=_blank>Education Equity Mentors</a>, and I lead workshops in STEM-focused outreach programs, like the <a href="https://jrmf.org/" target=_blank>
	 Julia Robinson Math Festival</a> and <a href="https://onha.yale.edu/pathways-science" target=_blank>Yale Pathways to Science.</a></p>
      <p>I will continue to share updates on my quantitative journey! If you have any advice for me, please feel free to reach out at james.elia@yale.edu</p>
