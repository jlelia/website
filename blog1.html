      <h2>Blog #1: Hello, Computer Science!</h2>
      <h3>16 May 2025</h3>

      <h4></h4>
      <p>As a young boy, I loved mathematics. I remember taking pride in completing my multiplication tables before my classmates or being the first to grasp a new
	      concept in class. As I grew older, I faced personal challenges that made my home life miserable. I stopped doing my homework, stopped asking questions,
	      and stopped being viewed as "gifted" in math. It wasn't long before I found myself on the lower track, and I started believing I belonged there.</p>

      <p>I nearly entered UMass Amherst as a political science major because of the calculus requirement in the natural sciences. But I decided college would
	      be my opportunity to turn things around, and I switched to biology during orientation weekend, no doubt causing headaches for my advisors. I figured
	      I could survive one class of calculus if it meant pursuing a degree I truly cared about.</p>

      <p>Only problem: I never took trigonometry or pre-calc. In fact, I never even encountered logarithms or fractional exponents, frequent operations in any 
	      calculus class. It felt like I had to work twice as hard to get half the grade, but I somehow scraped by with a B+. Statistics, chemistry, physics, and 
	      population genetics (AKA calculus but with fur) all went smoothly with my newfound confidence, and I achieved a 4.0 every semester after my first.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to the third summer of my PhD at Yale in the Pathology and Molecular Medicine program. Sick of a repetitive and unwieldy analysis, I started learning 
	      Python so I could write a simple automation script. As I learned more, I became obsessed. The power that just a little bit of programming competency brings to biology 
        is awe-inspiring. Combine that feeling with the artificial intelligence boom, and the realization comes naturally: "oh boy, I need math again".</p>

      <p>Between that fateful moment in July 2024 and now (May 2025), I've tried to read my way to a decent understanding of math, complexity, and AI. I started with books
        like <i>Why Machines Learn</i> by Anil Ananthaswamy, <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> by Melanie Mitchell, and <i>Chaos</i> by James Gleick. I shifted my focus from
        strictly cell biology and chemistry research articles to applications of machine learning therein. I've also taken full advantage of the generosity of the CS community
        with top-notch textbooks like <i>Modern Statistics for Modern Biology</i> by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber, and Harvard's CS50 Python course taught by David Malan.
      </p>

      <p>Of course, reading is not sufficient to build the skills I desire. In between experiments, I'm usually working on a programming
        project. Some are more fun, like <a href="/project1">building this website</a>, while others are directly related to my work in drug discovery,
        like <a href="/project2">CellPyAbility</a>. I also dabble with practice problems, like those in <i>Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained</i>
        by Al Sweigert or on <a href="https://projecteuler.net" target=_blank rel="noopener">Project Euler</a>. The latter is especially informative because
        the problems are one-part computational and one-part math theoretical.
      </p>

      <p>As a final piece of practice, I teach the very math I used to struggle with. I tutor for free through the non-profit I founded, <a href="https://e2mentors.org"
        target=_blank rel="noopener">Education Equity Mentors</a>, and I lead workshops in STEM-focused outreach programs, like the <a href="https://jrmf.org/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Julia Robinson Math Festival</a> and <a href="https://onha.yale.edu/pathways-science" target=_blank rel="noopener">Yale Pathways to Science.</a></p>

      <p>I will continue to share updates on my quantitative journey! If you have any advice for me, please feel free to reach out at james.elia@yale.edu</p>
