      <h2>Blog #3: The Joy of Math</h2>
      <h3>20 July 2025</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>On July 8th 2025, Meaghan and I led a workshop we designed for the 
         <a href="https://onha.yale.edu/pathways-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale Pathways to Science</a> summer program.
         We guided 25 New Haven high school seniors through two interactive lessons on applied mathematics: one on
         the area of a circle and the origins of calculus, and another on approximating the speed of light with marshmallows.
      </p>

      <h4>Giving credit</h4>
      <p>While the lessons cover old ideas (one of them thousands of years old), Professor Stephen Strogatz's books <em>The Joy of X</em> 
         and <em>Infinite Powers</em> are where I first read about them. Indeed, we titled our workshop "The Joy of Math" in his honor. You
         can find his author website <a href="https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Lesson #1: Geometric proof for the area of a circle</h4>
      <p>Materials
         <ul>
          <li>Whiteboard and markers (not necessary but recommended)</li>
          <li>Scissors (enough for all students, or pairs of students)</li>
          <li>Printed out circle templates (enough for all students, or pairs of students)</li>
          <li>Straight edges (enough for all students, or pairs of students)</li>
          <li>Drawing utensils (enough for all students, or pairs of students)</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>First, hand out scissors and pieces of paper with a circle outline printed upon them.
         I try to have something tangible (or at least interactive) when teaching, especially for pre-college students. Handing out props
         early helps build excitement, so we made no effort to hide the microwave and bag of marshmallows, either (more on that in Lesson #2).
      </p>

      <p>
         Next, ask some increasingly challenging questions, allowing the students to discuss: 
         <ul>
          <li>What makes a circle a circle?</li>
          <li>What is the area of a shape?</li>
          <li>How do we find the area of a rectangle?</li>
          <li>What properties of a circle make its area more difficult to measure?</li>
         </ul>
         Don't just accept textbook definitions like "length times width" for the area of a rectangle, ask them "why does that work?".
         Most people haven't considered that multiplication of two numbers is the same as the sum of a two-dimensional array with
         "length" rows and "width" columns. 
      <p>Visualization also provides an easy explanation of the commutative property of multiplication (<em>a</em> x <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> x <em>a</em>).
         5 rows of 4 columns is the same as 4 rows of 5 columns, or length and width are a matter of perspective. 
         These lines of reasoning will prime them for creative thinking and show math is something to understand, not memorize.
      </p>

         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Now that our brains are limber, it's time to begin the exercise! Ask the students to cut out their paper circles. Then,
         have them divide their circles in half with a pencil and straight edge, shading in one half of the circle and leaving the
         other blank. Next, have the students cut their circles into two symmetric halves. Ask the class: does it make it any easier
         to measure the area? Give a bit of time for them to try a few ideas, then repeat halving.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once the students get to eighths, some may start to catch on. If not, start to guide them with drawings on the whiteboard.
         Ask them to alternate the wedges (the shading makes this easier!) like in the diagram below. It should become increasingly clear
         that what was once their circle is now a close approximation of a rectangle. Now for the final piece of the puzzle, ask: what is the
         length of this rectangle-like shape? What is the width? 
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
         <img src="/images/circleProof.webp" alt="A figure showing the geometric definition of the area of a circle." loading="lazy">
	       <figcaption>By dividing our circle into smaller pieces, we can arrange the area into a rectangle of length one-half circumference (πr) 
          and width radius (r), resulting in the known formula πr². Unknown image source, please contact me for credit.

      </figure>
      <p>
         As a final discussion, talk about how this method of finding the area for difficult shapes by breaking them into smaller and smaller
         pieces laid the foundation for calculus. Here, I tied in my research on cancer therapeutics, where we sometimes want to know
         the area under a curve generated in experiments, like testing which drugs are best at stopping cancer cell growth.
      </p>

      <h4>Lesson #2: Approximating the speed of light with marshmallows</h4>
      <p>Materials
         <ul>
          <li>Whiteboard and markers (not necessary but recommended)</li>
          <li>One microwave with a known frequency (usually on a label on the edge of the door)</li>
          <li>One large bag of mini marshmallows</li>
          <li>One ruler with centimeter markings</li>
          <li>Paper plates (for melting marshmallows on)</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
         While Lesson #1 can work for any age, Lesson #2 is more abstract and may be difficult for pre-high-school students.
         Similar to Lesson #1, we open with some general discussion, building up the complexity of our questions:
         <ul>
          <li>What is light?</li>
          <li>What are some examples of light?</li>
          <li>Is all light visible?</li>
          <li>Does light always travel at the same speed?</li>
          <li>How does light travel?</li>
         </ul>
         Depending on the desired intensity, the last two bullets can lead to a foray into refraction and the Principle of Least
         Action. At the least, I would mention how refraction is what makes objects seem in different locations when looking through
         the surface of water. The more common experiences you can tie in, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
         Next, we lay down some foundation. Describe the light spectrum, bringing in real-world examples familiar to the students
         like visible light, ultra-violet light, X-rays, radiowaves, and microwaves! I would recommend labeling the light spectrum
         on the board as you give examples, discussing how smaller wavelengths have more energy.
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
         <img src="/images/lightSpec.webp" alt="A figure showing the light spectrum with labels." loading="lazy">
	       <figcaption>Students may be surprised to find that the properties of light change so greatly with wavelength.
          Try to generate as many "aha!" moments as you can (rainbows, sunburns, medical imaging). Image source: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants/the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/a/light-and-photosynthetic-pigments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a>.
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Now that the students understand that light is a wave, let's break down the properties of waves. It's important to
         note that the speed of light is constant (within a given medium), so we have:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
         <em>c</em> = λ * <em>f</em>
      </div>
      <p>
         where <em>c</em> is the speed of light in meters/second, λ is the wavelength in meters, and <em>f</em> is frequency
         in Hertz (second<sup>-1</sup>). I recommend <em>f</em> as opposed to <em>v</em> for frequency to avoid any confusion with velocity, which has 
         the same unit as <em>c</em>. Since the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength must be inversely proportional!
      </p>
      <p>
         This relationship may seem odd to the students at first, but we can use a runner's stride as an analogy: if two runners
         are moving at the same speed, and runner #1 has a longer stride (wavelength), runner #2 must have a quicker cadence (frequency).
      </p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">
         <img src="/images/waveProperties.webp" alt="A figure labeling the basic properties of a wave." loading="lazy">
	       <figcaption>Some of the basic properties of waves. Make sure to cover anti-nodes versus nodes since this will be key
          to the demonstration. Image source: James Elia using Canva.
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         As a final piece of background, discuss how the energy transfer of a wave is proportional to the square of the electric field.
         Then ask the students, where would we expect a microwave to create the most heat? At the nodes, at the anti-nodes? Does the sign
         of the amplitude matter?
      </p>
      <p>
         Time to bring it all home! Remove the turntable from the microwave and place a paper plate with a uniform layer of mini 
         marshmallows. Microwave the plate for about 10 seconds, then quickly remove it. There will be alternating bands of melted
         and unmelted marshmallows, representing anti-nodes and nodes, respectively. Walk around and show the students!
      </p>
      <p>
         Next, measure the distance between the center of the melted bands (anti-nodes) using a ruler in centimeters. We will need
         to convert to meters, which is also a nice lesson for the students. I measured 6 cm, or 0.06 meters. Remember, this is
         one-half of our wavelength, so double it to get the wavelength (0.12 meters).
      </p>
      <p>
         The wavelength (λ) is 0.12 meters. The frequency(<em>f</em>) of the microwave is 2450 MHz, or 2,450,000,000 Hz. Thus, our equation is:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
         <em>c</em> = (0.12 meters) * (2,450,000,000 Hz) = 294,000,000 m/s
      </div>
      <p>
        The measured speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, so our experiment gives a result within about 2% of the true value. 
        Not bad for marshmallows and a microwave!
